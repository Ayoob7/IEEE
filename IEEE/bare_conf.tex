% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Security education is not a part of the undergraduate

unaware of the applications of security vulnerabilities which
result in the creation of insecure applications. Due to this reason,
many Indian websites are compromised frequently. This paper
describes InCTF, India’s first CTF style ethical hacking contest
which helps in augmenting security education, both theoretical
and practical.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
Many Indian websites have been compromised frequently
in the past few years. A steady increase was found in the
occurrence of such security breaches from 2004 to 2009. The
mission of tracking the defacements of Indian websites were
done by Computer Emergency Response Team India (CERT-
In). And 6023 defacements were tracked in 2009 [3]. The
websites with .in domain were found to be defaced more . A
sum total 3042 .in domain websites were defaced. And several
more web sites probably exist which were compromised but
not documented [3].

Lack of security awareness is one of the key reasons behind
this staggering number of security breaches. Application
designers seldom follow secure coding practices while
designing applications. They fix bugs when a problem arises
rather than preventing the occurrence by writing secure codes.

This problem arises because security education is not
emphasized in their undergraduate education. Despite the fact
that need for computer security has increased greatly and the
availability of several tools to teach security concepts, security
education is not prevalent in India. Students tend to restrict
themselves to theoretical knowledge [4, 5, and 6] and
computer security can never be fully understood with
theoretical knowledge alone.

Computer security competitions and challenges are an
excellent method to foster innovation and educate students
about computer security in a highly-motivating environment
[7]. They are practical and if crafted properly, provide the
right amount of realistic scenario to facilitate learning of
security principles and vulnerabilities.
Amrita University has been a pioneer by participating in
various international CTF contests over for the past years and
incidentally the only one from India to do so. In 2010, Amrita University conducted India's first national level CTF style
ethical hacking contest InCTF. Conducted by the team of
students who represented Amrita University in the
international CTF contests, the event was a phenomenal
success. Another edition of the event was organized in the
following year, which was as successful as the previous
edition. This paper describes these two competitions and what
sets InCTF apart from other contests of the same kind.
\section{Related Work}
In the past, security exercises have been held in India in
conjunction with security conferences. The events usually
come with a fee to attend, which was not affordable for
students. There was no platform where the students could
improve their security skills for free. Also, such contests are
usually focussed on a particular area such as web security
where participants had to exploit vulnerabilities in a web
application and the realism involved in such events is quite
less. These contests required physical presence and students
are often unwilling to travel due to academic or other
commitments.

Several CTF style ethical contests especially for students
are organized annually such as iCTF by University of
California, Santa Barbara [1, 2], Collegiate Cyber Defense
Competition [4] and CIPHER CTF by RWTH, Aachen,
RuCTF and RuCTFe by Ural State University. However, not
all of these contests are international contests. And the
international contests are not beginner friendly and
participation in these requires previous knowledge of
advanced security principles and vulnerabilities, of which
there is a lack in India. This was probably the reason for a lack
of participation of teams from India in such competitions.

Eventhough several security exercises existed, they didnt
suit the present scenario in India. Hence, a different well
tailored format was created which suited the present Indian
scenario. In the following sections, we present two CTF style
ethical hacking contests organized in 2010 and 2011, the
outcomes, learning and challenges involved in organizing
them.
\section{The Contest}
The contest was conducted in two editions in 2010 and 2011, both by Amrita University and TIFAC CORE in association with VeriSign. The format of both the events weren largely the same, no much changes were made. In the second edition only a slight variations were made. Both of the events are briefly described
separately.

\subsection{InCTF 2010}
The contest featured 290 teams from 150 premier
institutions, including IITs and NITs, from 19 states. This was
truly a rare achievement for any contest of this kind in India.
It was held from February 2010 to March 2010.


\subsubsection{First Round: Learning Round}
Almost all CTF contests require participants to have prior
knowledge of security vulnerabilities and principles. This
however is not the scenario in India where majority of the
students have little or no exposure to the same.

The first round was specially designed to address this issue.
The round highlighted what would eventually be useful in
later stages of the contest. The set of tasks exposed the student
to basics of Linux, networking, Apache, PHP, SQL,
cryptography, phishing, secure coding and cyber laws. On
completion of this learning round, students were equipped
with knowledge that enabled them to perform better in
subsequent rounds as well as become confident that they can
indeed make a mark in this contest. This was a radical
departure from traditional CTF's, which serve as a finishing
test for information security courses.
\subsubsection{Second Round: Web Application Exploit}
The second round was a web application exploit round. It
was modelled on the format of the popular online hacking and
security web site Hack This Site's basic missions. Popular
exploits such as SQL injection, Javascript injections etc. were
among the flaws of the web application.

Participants had to penetrate into a vulnerable web
application and points (100, 250 or 500) were awarded for
each vulnerability they discovered. Timestamps were used to
resolve ties, if any. 30 teams qualified to the final round.
\subsubsection{Final Round: Network based CTF style contest}
The final round was held in February, 2010. 30 teams from
across India participated in the 5 hour long round. The round
was played over a Virtual Private Network and each team was
assigned an IP address range.

Each team had a copy of the vulnerable machine in a virtual
environment such as Virtual Box and their goal was to
discover and fix vulnerabilities as well as exploit the machines
of other teams using the same. The ethical element was
ensured by not scoring any flag submissions during the initial
period and instead encouraged team’s advisories highlighting
vulnerabilities and how to fix them. These advisories were
publicly visible, which was visible to all teams. Thus, all
teams could look at submissions and apply the suggested
patches to their vulnerable machine. Points were awarded tothe advisories submitted depending on the quality of the
advisory, the vulnerability reported and the proposed fix for
the same.

The following table lists the teams who finished in the top
three places of InCTF 2010.


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the

% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.



\section{Conclusion}
Security education is not prevalent in India and that is the
important reason why several Indian websites are
compromised on a regular basis. The key reason is lack of
emphasis on security education, both theoretical and practical,
in the courses all over India. By hosting InCTF for couple of
consecutive years, several students have been exposed to
security principles, vulnerabilities and the need for security in
today's world. Thus live security exercises are a useful tool to
augment and spread security education.

A CTF contest can only augment what has already been
learnt but can never replace the formal training. Security
education requires to be included in the curriculum in order to
be effective. Nevertheless, a third edition of the event has
been scheduled to take place later this year. We are hoping
that the contest reaches far and wide thus exposing several
students’ security vulnerabilities and security practices and
eventually security education will be made part of the
undergraduate curriculum
